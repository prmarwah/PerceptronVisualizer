# PerceptronVisualizer
Implementation of Perceptron Learning Algorithm, plotting the decision boundary over the dataset after each iteration.

A random classification dataset is produced using the scikit-learn make_classification generator.

The Pocket version of PLA is used to produce better results on non linearly separable datasets (which may be produced by the generator), or cases where the algorithm failed to converge within 50 iterations.
